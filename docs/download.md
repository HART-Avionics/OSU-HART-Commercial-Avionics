### Getting Started
This assumes the Avionics system is comprised of Altus Metrum products including the Telemega, Easymega, and Teledongle. Our rocket utilizes a 4 inch airframe and the AV bay is designed as such. To track and configure the flight computers you will first need to download the AltOS software here: https://altusmetrum.org/AltOS/
This software will allow you to operate the Teledongle as well as configure, test, calibrate, and monitor the flight computers. Information on the use of this software can be found here: https://altusmetrum.org/AltOS/doc/altusmetrum.html
